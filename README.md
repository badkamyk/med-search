## Getting Started
MedSearch project is using public Clinical Trials API. Its purpose is to get the crucial data of the research like the outcome measures, sponsors, publication date and conditions. By using this data you'll be able to find the most relevant clinical trials for your research.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
